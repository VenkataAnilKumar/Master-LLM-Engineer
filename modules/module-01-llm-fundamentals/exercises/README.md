## Exercise 1: Tokenization Deep Dive ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Objective:** Understand how different texts are tokenized and estimate costs.

**Tasks:**
1. Load a sample Wikipedia article (500+ words)
2. Tokenize it using `tiktoken` for GPT-4
3. Calculate:
   - Total tokens
   - Tokens per sentence
   - Tokens per word
   - Cost for processing with GPT-4 input + output (assume 200 token response)
4. Compare tokenization between English, Chinese, and code snippets

**Starter Code:**
```python
import tiktoken
import wikipedia

enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")

# Get article
article = wikipedia.page("Machine Learning").content

# Your code here
```

**Expected Output:**
- Token count analysis
- Cost estimation
- Comparison table

## Exercise 2: Semantic Search Engine ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Objective:** Build a mini semantic search engine using embeddings.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a knowledge base of 20 programming concepts with descriptions
2. Generate embeddings for each concept
3. Build a `search(query)` function that:
   - Generates embedding for the query
   - Finds top-3 most similar concepts
   - Returns results with similarity scores
4. Test with diverse queries

**Example Knowledge Base:**
```python
concepts = {
    "for loop": "A control structure that repeats a block of code...",
    "recursion": "A function that calls itself to solve problems...",
    # Add 18 more
}
```

**Test Queries:**
- "repeating code execution"
- "function calling itself"
- "organizing code into reusable blocks"

**Expected Output:**
```
Query: "repeating code execution"
1. for loop (similarity: 0.87)
2. while loop (similarity: 0.82)
3. iteration (similarity: 0.79)
```

3. For each temperature, generate 5 responses

4. Evaluate:
   - Consistency (do responses vary?)
   - Quality (are they useful?)
   - Creativity (are they interesting?)

5. Recommend optimal temperature with justification

**Test Prompts:**
```python
# Chatbot
"How do I reset my password?"

# Creative writing
"Write the first paragraph of a sci-fi novel"

# Code docs
"Document this function: def binary_search(arr, target): ..."
```

**Expected Output:**
- Temperature comparison table
- Sample outputs for each temperature
- Recommendation with reasoning

## Exercise 5: Cost Tracking Dashboard ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Objective:** Build a comprehensive cost tracking system.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a `CostTracker` class that:

   - Aggregates daily/monthly totals
   - Exports to CSV/JSON

2. Add visualization functions:
   - Daily cost over time
   - Cost by model
   - Token usage distribution

3. Implement alerts:
   - Warn if daily cost exceeds $X
   - Alert if token usage is unusually high

4. Test with simulated API calls

**Implementation:**
```python
class CostTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.calls = []
        self.pricing = {...}
    
    def log_call(self, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, timestamp):
        # Your code
        pass
    
    def get_daily_cost(self, date):
        # Your code
        pass
    
    def visualize_costs(self):
        # Your code
        pass
```

**Expected Output:**
- Working cost tracker with all methods
- Sample visualizations
- CSV export of logged calls

## Exercise 6: Embedding Visualization ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Objective:** Visualize high-dimensional embeddings in 2D.

**Tasks:**
1. Generate embeddings for 50 diverse words/phrases
2. Use dimensionality reduction (PCA or t-SNE) to reduce to 2D
3. Create an interactive scatter plot:
   - Points are words
   - Hover shows the word
   - Color by category (animals, tech, emotions, etc.)

**Categories:**
```python
words = {
    "animals": ["dog", "cat", "elephant", ...],
    "tech": ["computer", "algorithm", "data", ...],
    "emotions": ["happy", "sad", "excited", ...],
    "actions": ["run", "jump", "think", ...],
}
```

**Expected Output:**
- 2D scatter plot with clustered similar concepts
- Interactive Plotly visualization
- Observations about semantic relationships

## Exercise 7: Context Window Management ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Objective:** Handle conversations that exceed context limits.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a `ConversationManager` class:
   - Tracks conversation history
   - Monitors token count
   - Automatically truncates when approaching limit
   - Preserves important context (system message, recent messages)

2. Implement strategies:
   - **Strategy A:** Remove oldest messages
   - **Strategy B:** Summarize old messages
   - **Strategy C:** Keep only last N exchanges

3. Test with a long conversation (20+ exchanges)

**Implementation:**
```python
class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self, model="gpt-4", max_tokens=8000):
        self.model = model
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.messages = []
    
    def add_message(self, role, content):
        # Your code
        pass
    
    def get_context(self):
        # Your code - returns truncated messages
        pass
```

**Expected Output:**
- Working conversation manager
- Comparison of different strategies
- Token usage analytics
